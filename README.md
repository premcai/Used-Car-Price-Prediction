THIS PROJECT IS DONE WITH R PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. CHECK REPOSITORIES FOR PYTHON.

I am performing basic Data Analysis here with R. I am using Three Regression Models and a Classification model to find out the ACTUAL PRICES
and SELLING PRICES and compare it in a table like format. 
This should give insights on Preprocessing, Visualization and Regression.
